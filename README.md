## Welcome to Street Life photography of Athens new website
Whoever is curious what is it about, can see more on [wixsite adress] ( http://malamatina.wixsite.com/streetlife)
I used wixsite because it is the convinient for managing photos, and galleries, for photoportfolios, and showcases. 
This is a tranzit to new more documentary-oriented base of photographies, and other materials, such as videos, texts etc.

### Athens - connection of antient and modern life
It is a kind of guide throw the city (anti-turistic) maybe more in a spirit of "avantourism", and rewilding known, 
nature oriented, anarcho-primitivsm, psycho-geography, with new mythology.  Also anti-history,in Nietzschean sense, and anti-ideology, anti-civilisation (in Russo's sense).
